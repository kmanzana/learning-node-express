// When I send an HTTP POST to /retro I want it to create a new retro with:
// - a name for the retro
// - team name
// - anything else you think is important

// When I send a GET to /retro, I want to see a JSON list of retros.

// Save them in mongo, use mongoosejs. Don't worry about a UI, use "Simple Rest Client", a chrome plugin, to make PUT requests.
