learning-node-express
=====================

My attempt at learning the hipster stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Jade, and more

Oh, and I'm trying to do TDD the whole way through: Mocha, Sinon, and Supertest

To run tests in `/Users/kmanzanares/Projects/learning` run:

```
mocha spec --recursive
```
